# Getting Started

This document details the process of working with this project. We recommend working inside an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as you need to clone the [github repository](https://github.com/iragca/DS413-final-project) for this project.

Simply clone the repo in your desired file directory using your favorite [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iragca/DS413-final-project.git
```

Or you can do so graphically in your favorite [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

# Setup

We work with uv. You can install it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)

[Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) is also required and can be installed by running:

```bash
uv python install 3.13
```

Read more about this [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/).

Then install dependencies:

```bash
make requirements   #  Install dependencies
```

# Dataset Manager

```bash
make data           #  Run the CLI dataset manager
```

Functionalities

- Download datasets
- Deduplicated files
- Splitting the MegaPlantDataset

## How to Navigate

To navigate the CLI dataset manager, you will need a keyboard. The following tables shows the hotkeys needed for navigation.

| Keybind      | Functionality                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+C`     | Quit the app or current menu     |
| `Arrow Keys` | Navigate choices                 |
| `Space`      | Select choice (multiple Choices) |
| `Enter`      | Confirm choice                   |

## Downloading a datatset

You can download a dataset by using the CLI dataset manager by selecting the `Download datasets` option. If you've just started working with this project, then you need to download the [MegaPlant dataset](1.0-paper.md) (`megaplant_dataset`) locally, will take up ~2.20GB of storage.

You can also individually download the datasets that compose the [MegaPlant dataset](1.0-paper.md).

- [`plantvillage_dataset`](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1511.08060) ~2.18GB
- [`plant_doc_dataset`](https://doi.org/10.1145/3371158.3371196) ~1.00GB
- [`diamos_dataset`](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11112107) ~8.50GB

# Development

```bash
make lint           #  Lint the code
make format         #  Format the code
make docs           #  Run a local jupyter-book server for documentation
make tests          #  Run unit tests
```
