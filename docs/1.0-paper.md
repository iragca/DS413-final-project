+++ { "part": "abstract" }

We propose a case study of applying deep learning in plant disease detection under multiple conditions as part of our coursework in DS413 Deep Learning. We introduce as a background what plant symptoms are and how our case study tackles the issue of visually identifying plant illnesses. We identified both conventional and unconventional plant disease detection techniques. The shortcomings and advantages of recent advancements in deep learning-based plant disease detection were examined, and we learned how we might approach the challenge of deep learning-based plant disease detection, especially on datasets of leaf images under various conditions, such as laboratory, field, and stock images.

# Background

Plant diseases are abnormal changes in appearance and behaviour that progresses over time, unlike plant injury that occurs immediately ([DeBusk, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM2X-XBRKHM)).

This video introduces various types of pathogens and their symptoms which are the causes of plant diseases.
:::
::::

These are caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungus, oomycetes (fungus-like micro-organisms), parasitic nematodes (worm-like micro-organisms), and parasitic plants. Pathogens and pests ({abbr}`P&Ps (Pathogens and pests)`) account for about 20% and at least 10% of harvest yield loss in major crops ([Savary et al., 2019, 1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0793-y); [Strange & Scott, 2005, 83](http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.phyto.43.113004.133839)).

:::::

Although most diseases are caused by pathogens or {term}`biotic` factors, some are a result of direct injury or {term}`abiotic` factors, also called environmental factors. These factors are drought, winter, disruptive human activities, etc. Diseases caused by {term}`abiotic` factors are easier to diagnose but harder to control ([Agrios, 2009, 613](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00344-8)).

Considering that these pathogens are micro-organisms and invisible to the human eye, the method for identifying if a plant is unhealthy or infected is by identifying the symptoms and signs visually. However, identifying the exact disease-causing agent will require certain procedures often done by professional plant pathologists ([Strange & Scott, 2005, 96](http://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.phyto.43.113004.133839); [UNH Extension, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HnLVYhvars)).

## Symptoms

To diagnose a plant immediately is by looking at the symptoms, these symptoms are reactions of the plant to the pathogen, not necessarily a sign of the particular pathogen itself. Signs of a plant disease are physical evidence of the causal agent or pathogen, signs are not symptoms ([Penn State Extension, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6GoSy8RjUM)).

(a) localized lesions caused by virus ([Colson et al., 2010](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010041)), 4; (b) an apple exuding bacterial ooze, (c) scorched leaf symptoms caused by bacteria, (d) {term}`canker` on a leaf stem, (e) tomato ring malformations, (f) mosaic pattern symptom (g) dwarfism/stunted growth and bronzing caused by virus, (h) malformation and mosaic pattern symptoms, (i) tree bark afflicted with rot ([Agrios, 2009, 627-634](https://www.doi.org/10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00344-8)).
:::::

Symptoms caused by {term}`abiotic` factors are referred to as disorders. These symptoms are usually uniform, affecting large or evenly distributed areas of vegetation. In contrast, diseases caused by pathogens are often non-uniform and appear as scattered or irregular patches in the field ([UNH Extension, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HnLVYhvars)).

With deep learning models that focus on visual inspection for plant disease detection, it may be more practical to determine if a plant is unhealthy or otherwise, rather than detecting specific diseases or disorders. For example, a deep learning model may classify a plant as unhealthy due to bronzing during autumn, but may be harder to determine what the disease or disorder is, without additional temporal or environmental context.

:::::

[](#figure-3) shows the same symptoms in two different plants but caused by different factors. This shows that environmental context will be needed when diagnosing plant diseases. As such, this case study will focus only on identifying whether a plant is healthy or unhealthy based on the symptoms observed by the human eye.

## Signs

:::::

Signs are physical evidence of the pathogen or pest, the real cause of the plant disease. Knowing the signs is key information to generating actions or solutions for {abbr}`P&P (Pathogens and pests)` management.

Observing the signs is a sure enough method to indicate that the plant might be unhealthy. However, that will take a more complex deep learning model, to consider another piece of information, for example, the bugs scattered on the branches, or fungus hyphae fully covering the subject leaf or plant. This study’s scope will only incorporate symptoms observed on the leaves and some simpler signs, like fungus mildew.

## Detection Methods

Plant disease detection can be performed using a range of approaches, from traditional manual observation to advanced computational techniques. Each method varies in accuracy, cost, scalability, and practicality depending on the use case.

### Manual and Laboratory Methods

Visual inspection is the most common and oldest method, where farmers or plant pathologists examine the visible symptoms on leaves, stems, or fruits such as spots, blight, or discoloration. Although simple and fast, this method is subjective and heavily reliant on human expertise and environmental conditions ([Penn State Extension, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6GoSy8RjUM)).

In laboratory diagnostics, several scientific tests are employed to accurately identify pathogens:

- **Microscopy** – Used to observe fungal spores or bacterial colonies.  
- **Culture tests** – Pathogens are isolated and grown in nutrient media for species identification.  
- **Serological tests (e.g., ELISA)** – Use antibodies to detect specific proteins associated with viruses or bacteria.  
- **Molecular techniques (PCR, qPCR, LAMP)** – Detect pathogen DNA or RNA, offering high sensitivity and specificity ([Ward et al., 2004](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2004.tb00354.x); [Schaad et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.phyto.41.052002.095435)).

While these approaches are precise, they require laboratory equipment, trained personnel, and are not suitable for large-scale or real-time monitoring.

### Image Processing

Before the advent of deep learning, plant disease detection often relied on handcrafted features derived from image processing.

Key features such as color, texture, and shape were extracted using algorithms like:

- Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for texture analysis
- Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for surface variation
- Color histograms in RGB or HSV space for spotting discoloration

These features were then classified using traditional machine learning algorithms such as:

- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Random Forests
- Naïve Bayes classifiers

For example, ([Pydipati et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.01.004)) demonstrated that SVM models using color and texture features achieved high accuracy in detecting citrus diseases. However, the performance of these systems is limited by the need for manual feature engineering, and they often fail to generalize well to diverse environmental conditions.

### Spectral and Sensor-Based Method

More recently, spectral imaging technologies such as hyperspectral, multispectral, and thermal imaging have been applied for early plant disease detection. These methods capture light reflectance across multiple wavelengths, including the visible, near-infrared (NIR), and thermal infrared regions. Diseased plants exhibit distinct reflectance patterns, enabling early detection even before visible symptoms appear ([Mahlein, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-15-0340-FE)).

Such approaches are commonly integrated into precision agriculture systems, where drones or UAVs collect large-scale field data. Despite their promise, these systems are often expensive, complex to analyze, and require specialized sensors, limiting their accessibility to smallholder farmers.

# Recent Advances
Recent developments in deep learning have significantly improved plant leaf disease detection. Traditional CNNs such as VGG16 and ResNet are still widely used, but newer approaches focus on improving model accuracy, generalization, and field performance. One major advancement is the integration of attention mechanisms and Transformer-based models, which provide stronger feature extraction and robustness in real agricultural environments (Ashurov et al., 2025). These models help address challenges like varying lighting and complex backgrounds, which often reduce CNN performance in real-field conditions (Nyawose et al., 2025).
Another important trend is the development of lightweight and mobile-friendly architectures optimized for edge computing. Recent reviews highlight that compact CNN models can achieve high accuracy while being efficient enough for deployment on smartphones or IoT devices used in farms (Upadhyay et al., 2025). This allows farmers to detect diseases in real time without needing high-end hardware.
Researchers have also focused on multi-crop and large-scale datasets, enabling models to recognize multiple plant diseases across different species rather than being limited to one crop at a time (Elfouly et al., 2025). This improves the practicality of deep learning models for real agricultural use.


# Current limitations

## Known datasets

[Singh et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3371158.3371196) proposed plant disease datasets have little diversity due to the laboratory conditions the image datasets were taken in, particularly datasets like the PlantVillage dataset by [Hughes & Salathé (2015)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1511.08060). Their PlantDoc dataset improves upon this limitation but doesn’t account for images with uniform background.

# Methodology

We propose MegaPlant, a combination of both types of datasets of different domains such that we output a model that can generalize regardless of the conditions of the leaf images. Datasets we aim to combine are PlantDoc, PlantVillage, and DiaMOS, a dataset of pear fruits and leaves ([Fenu & Malloci, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11112107)). However, we only aim to combine the leaf images, not fruits.

## Splits

We will split the dataset into 3 splits: training, validation, and test with ratios of 0.7, 0.2, 0.1 respectively. We split the dataset into 3 sets to provide a less biased evaluation when training a model.

# Objectives

We hope to determine our proposed method of plant disease detection by applying a CNN or similar deep learning technology to a diverse set of leaf images with varying conditions, including both lab and on field conditions is feasible and deemed practical to be applied in future work of more complex plant disease detection tasks. Conditions such as laboratories with uniform backgrounds, on field conditions with noisy backgrounds and lighting, and also stock images.

As members of society, we hope that we contribute knowledge to the field of deep learning with plant pathology and by extension the farming industry. We hope to contribute to the production of food through farmers utilizing innovations in plant disease detection and related technology, by doing so we move one step closer to solving world hunger.

# Summary

We introduced the basics of plant pathology to give an idea of where our case study might be situated in the research field. We discussed what symptoms are and how our case study approaches the problem of detecting plant diseases by detecting the symptoms visually. We identified traditional and alternative methods of plant disease detection. These methods often required feature engineering steps or expensive requirement

The weaknesses and strengths of innovations in plant disease detection using deep learning were discussed and informed us of how we might tackle the problem of detecting plant diseases using deep learning, particularly on datasets of leaf images with varying conditions such as laboratory, on field conditions, and stock images.
