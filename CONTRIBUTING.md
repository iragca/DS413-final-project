# Setup

We recommend working inside an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as you need to clone the [github repository](https://github.com/iragca/DS413-final-project) for this project.

We work with uv. You can install it [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/)

```bash
make requirements   #  Install dependencies
```

# Development

```bash
make lint           #  Lint the code
make format         #  Format the code
make docs           #  Run a local jupyter-book server for documentation
make tests          #  Run unit tests
```
